# Phoenix Frontend

The Phoenix Frontend is a TypeScript-based application that utilizes yarn workspaces to manage multiple packages. It consists of several packages located in the `/packages` directory. Each package has a specific purpose and contributes to the overall functionality of the application.

## Packages

### [UI](https://github.com/Phoenix-Protocol-Group/phoenix-frontend/tree/main/packages/ui)

The `UI` package is a UI kit based on Material-UI (MUI). It provides a set of reusable components and styles that follow the Material Design guidelines. These components can be used across the application to create a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

### [State](https://github.com/Phoenix-Protocol-Group/phoenix-frontend/tree/main/packages/state)

The `State` package is responsible for managing all the application's states. It includes recoil along with its associated actions, reducers, and selectors. This package ensures that the application's data is efficiently managed and updated in response to user interactions or external events.

### [Utils](https://github.com/Phoenix-Protocol-Group/phoenix-frontend/tree/main/packages/utils)

The `Utils` package contains various utility and helper functions that are used throughout the application. These functions are designed to perform common tasks, such as data manipulation, date formatting, string operations, or network requests. The `Utils` package provides a centralized location for these functions, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

### Core

The `Core` package serves as the central package that brings all the other packages together. It acts as the main entry point of the application, coordinating the initialization and integration of the UI, state management, and utility functions. The `Core` package establishes the foundation for the application's architecture and provides the necessary interfaces for interaction between different parts of the system.

### Demo

The `Demo` package is just a playground for internal demos and to play around with the soroban sdk. Only used for internal tests and unstable.

## Getting Started
