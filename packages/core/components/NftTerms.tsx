          Become a DEGENesis Artist on Phoenix!
        </Typography>
        <Typography paragraph>
          This form is for prospective artists who want to have their collection
          live on Phoenix Day 1 when the NFT Marketplace launches. Being genesis
          creators has several benefits. Phoenix will feature these collections
          within the marketplace. We will also host a Twitter/X space with the
          creators. Finally, we will create a Discord chat for your collections.
          {/* eslint-disable-next-line react/no-unescaped-entities */}
          We look forward to your submissions and can't wait to launch!
